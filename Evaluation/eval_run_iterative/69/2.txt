ITERATION 1 of 3: Extracted Transformation Rules

Observations / rules
1. Preserve the original top-row motif: the two gray horizontal length-2 segments at (0,2)-(0,3) and (0,7)-(0,8) and the gray isolated point at (0,5) remain unchanged in the output. The existing vertical gray line at (2,9)-(3,9) also remains.

2. Promote the top-row motif into a 2-row red block one step down (shift +2 rows):
   - Each gray horizontal length-2 on row 0 becomes a red 2x2 square whose top-left is two rows below the original horizontal (so horizontals at (0,2)-(0,3) and (0,7)-(0,8) -> red squares top-left (2,2) and (2,7), size 2).
   - The gray isolated point at (0,5) becomes a red vertical length-2 line at (2,5)-(3,5).

3. For every isolated gray point in the rightmost area at column 9 (here at rows 6 and 8), place a red copy of the top-row motif on that same row:
   - On each such row r (r=6 and r=8): add red horizontals (r,2)-(r,3) and (r,7)-(r,8) and an isolated red point at (r,5).
   - Leave the original gray points at (6,9) and (8,9) intact (they remain gray points).

Primitives present in the output (as produced)
- grid_size(output,10,10)
- horizontal gray: start(0,2)-end(0,3), start(0,7)-end(0,8) (length 2)
- isolated gray point: (0,5)
- vertical gray line: start(2,9)-end(3,9) (length 2)
- red 2x2 squares: top_left(2,2)-bottom_right(3,3) and top_left(2,7)-bottom_right(3,8) (size 2)
- red vertical line: start(2,5)-end(3,5) (length 2)
- for r=6 and r=8: horizontal red lines start(r,2)-end(r,3) and start(r,7)-end(r,8) (length 2) and isolated red point (r,5)
- gray points preserved at (6,9) and (8,9)
ITERATION 2 of 3: Extracted Transformation Rules

Conclusion: the new pair (grid_1) supports and slightly refines the previously inferred rule.

Refined rule set (concise)
- Identify a top-row motif on row 0: one or more gray horizontal length-2 segments and one or more gray isolated points at fixed column offsets relative to those horizontals. This top-row motif is preserved unchanged in the output (same gray pixels).

- For every input isolated gray point in the rightmost column (col 9) at some row r > 0:
  - Replicate the top-row motif on that same row r, but in red:
    - Place red horizontal length-2 segments at the same column spans as the top-row horizontals, on row r.
    - Place red isolated points at the same column offsets as the top-row isolated points, on row r.
  - Leave the original gray point at (r,9) intact (it remains gray).

- Additional 2-row promotion (conditional):
  - If there exists a vertical gray line of length 2 in the rightmost column specifically at start(2,9)-end(3,9), then also create a promoted 2-row red version of the top-row motif shifted down by +2 rows:
    - Each top-row horizontal length-2 becomes a red 2x2 square with top-left at (2, column_start).
    - Each top-row isolated point becomes a red vertical length-2 at rows 2–3 at that column.
  - The vertical gray anchor (start(2,9)-end(3,9)) is preserved.

Primitives expected in outputs (based on above)
- grid_size unchanged.
- top-row gray horizontals and isolated gray points (preserved).
- For each input gray point at (r,9): red horizontals at (r, same horizontals columns) and red isolated points at (r, same isolated-point columns); original gray (r,9) preserved.
- If vertical gray at (2,9)-(3,9) present in input: red squares sized 2 at top-lefts (2, horizontal_starts) and red vertical lines (2, isolated_cols)-(3, isolated_cols) added; gray vertical preserved.

Evidence:
- grid_1 shows straightforward replication of the top-row motif in red onto rows r=2,4,7 where input had gray points at col 9 (no 2-row promotion because no vertical gray anchor).
- grid_2 includes both the per-row red copies (at r=6,8) and the conditional 2-row red promotion (red 2x2 squares and verticals at rows 2–3) because input contained the vertical gray anchor at (2,9)-(3,9).
ITERATION 3 of 3: Extracted Transformation Rules

Conclusion: The new pair (grid_0) supports and slightly reinforces the previously inferred rule set. It provides an example where the top-row motif contains only isolated points (no horizontals), and the model copies only those primitives accordingly.

Refined rule set (concise)
- Identify the top-row motif on row 0: the set of gray horizontal length-2 segments and the set of gray isolated points present on row 0. Preserve these top-row gray primitives unchanged in the output.

- For every input gray isolated point at (r,9) with r > 0:
  - Replicate the top-row motif on row r in red:
    - For each top-row gray horizontal length-2 at columns c..c+1, place a red horizontal length-2 at row r, columns c..c+1.
    - For each top-row gray isolated point at column c, place a red isolated point at (r,c).
  - Leave the original gray point at (r,9) unchanged (remains gray).

- Conditional 2-row promotion (only when a gray vertical length-2 exists at (2,9)-(3,9)):
  - Promote the top-row motif into a 2-row red block covering rows 2–3:
    - Each top-row horizontal (c..c+1) becomes a red 2x2 square with top-left at (2,c).
    - Each top-row isolated point at column c becomes a red vertical_line from (2,c) to (3,c).
  - Preserve the gray vertical anchor at (2,9)-(3,9).

How grid_0 fits
- Top-row had only isolated gray points at columns 0,3,7 → preserved.
- Input gray points at (3,9) and (7,9) → rows 3 and 7 get red isolated points at columns 0,3,7; original (3,9) and (7,9) remain gray.
- No vertical gray anchor → no 2-row promotion occurs.

Primitives expected in outputs (based on above)
- grid_size unchanged.
- top-row gray primitives preserved (horizontals if any, isolated points).
- For each input gray point at (r,9): red horizontals on row r matching top-row horizontals (if present) and red isolated points on row r matching top-row isolated-point columns; original gray (r,9) preserved.
- If gray vertical length-2 at (2,9)-(3,9) present: add red 2x2 squares at top-lefts (2, horizontal_starts) for each top-row horizontal and red vertical lines from (2, c) to (3, c) for each top-row isolated point column.

No contradictions found; grid_0 is consistent with and clarifies the rule (handles the case where the top-row motif contains only isolated points).
FINAL RULE EXPLANATION:

  - Replicate the top-row motif on row r in red:
    - For each top-row gray horizontal length-2 at columns c..c+1, place a red horizontal length-2 at row r, columns c..c+1.
    - For each top-row gray isolated point at column c, place a red isolated point at (r,c).
  - Leave the original gray point at (r,9) unchanged (remains gray).

- For each input gray point at (r,9): red horizontals on row r matching top-row horizontals (if present) and red isolated points on row r matching top-row isolated-point columns; original gray (r,9) preserved.
- If gray vertical length-2 at (2,9)-(3,9) present: add red 2x2 squares at top-lefts (2, horizontal_starts) for each top-row horizontal and red vertical lines from (2, c) to (3, c) for each top-row isolated point column.

No contradictions found; grid_0 is consistent with and clarifies the rule (handles the case where the top-row motif contains only isolated points).

STEP 4: Predicted Test Output

Natural language summary:
- Grid size stays 10x10.
- The top-row gray motif is preserved: a gray horizontal length-2 at row 0 columns 2–3, and gray isolated points at (0,0), (0,6), (0,8).
- Because a gray vertical anchor exists at (2,9)-(3,9), the top-row motif is promoted into a 2-row red block covering rows 2–3:
  - The top-row horizontal (cols 2–3) becomes a red 2x2 block occupying (2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(3,3).
  - Each top-row isolated point column (0,6,8) becomes a red vertical length-2 at those columns spanning rows 2–3.
- For each input gray isolated point at (r,9) with r>0 (here r=5,7,9), the top-row motif is also replicated on that single row in red:
  - A red horizontal length-2 at columns 2–3 on row r.
  - Red isolated points at columns 0,6,8 on row r.
  - The original gray point at (r,9) is preserved.
- The gray vertical anchor at (2,9)-(3,9) is preserved.
