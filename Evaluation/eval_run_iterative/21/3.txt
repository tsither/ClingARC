ITERATION 1 of 4: Extracted Transformation Rules

Observed rule summary
- Ignore all non-blue shapes (red crosses, yellow line). Only the blue primitives determine the output.
- Crop to the minimal bounding box containing all blue cells; set output grid_size to that box (here 4x4).
- Recolor blue → green.
- Merge adjacent/collinear blue fragments into maximal straight segments (extend/connect diagonal, horizontal and vertical fragments where they meet) and emit those merged primitives at the same relative coordinates inside the bounding box.

Predicted output primitives (derived from merging the blue fragments and recoloring them green)
- grid_size(output,4,4)
- diagonal_line(output,start(0,0),end(2,2),color(green),length(3))
- diagonal_line(output,start(0,1),end(2,3),color(green),length(3))
- diagonal_line(output,start(3,0),end(1,2),color(green),length(3))
- diagonal_line(output,start(3,1),end(2,2),color(green),length(2))
- horizontal_line(output,start(0,0),end(0,1),color(green),length(2))
- horizontal_line(output,start(1,1),end(1,2),color(green),length(2))
- horizontal_line(output,start(2,1),end(2,3),color(green),length(3))
- horizontal_line(output,start(3,0),end(3,1),color(green),length(2))
- vertical_line(output,start(0,1),end(3,1),color(green),length(4))
- vertical_line(output,start(1,2),end(2,2),color(green),length(2))
ITERATION 2 of 4: Extracted Transformation Rules

Verdict
- Supported: core steps from the previous hypothesis — non-blue shapes are ignored; the output is the minimal bounding box containing all blue cells (grid_size 4x4 here); all blue pixels are recolored green in the output.
- Contradicted / needs refinement: the prior claim “merge adjacent/collinear blue fragments into maximal straight segments strictly using only originally filled cells” is too rigid. The new case shows the output sometimes (a) fills a missing pixel at a junction so that straight primitives can connect, and (b) splits/represents strokes as a mixture of short diagonals + short horizontals/verticals rather than a single maximal primitive even when a longer contiguous run existed in the input.

Refined rule (concise)
1. Keep only blue pixels; crop to their minimal bounding box -> set grid_size to that box (4x4).
2. Recolor blue → green.
3. Represent the blue pattern inside that bounding box as a network of straight primitives (horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and isolated points). To create that network the system:
   - preserves existing contiguous runs when possible,
   - connects fragments along straight directions so strokes become continuous (this can add a filled cell at a junction if needed),
   - decomposes complex junctions into multiple short straight primitives (rather than always a single maximal segment).
4. Output primitives are the set of these straight segments (and occasional isolated points) expressed with coordinates relative to the cropped bounding box.

Primitives expected in this specific output (as observed)
- grid_size(output,4,4)
- diagonal_line(output,start(0,1),end(2,3),color(green),length(3))
- diagonal_line(output,start(1,0),end(0,1),color(green),length(2))
- diagonal_line(output,start(1,1),end(2,2),color(green),length(2))
- diagonal_line(output,start(3,2),end(2,3),color(green),length(2))
- horizontal_line(output,start(1,0),end(1,2),color(green),length(3))
- horizontal_line(output,start(2,2),end(2,3),color(green),length(2))
- vertical_line(output,start(0,1),end(1,1),color(green),length(2))
- vertical_line(output,start(1,2),end(3,2),color(green),length(3))
- isolated_point(output,(3,0),green)

Summary
- Keep the prior high-level rule (ignore non-blue, crop, recolor). Update the merging rule: primitives are created to form continuous straight strokes inside the crop even if that requires filling junction pixels and decomposing strokes into multiple short primitives.
ITERATION 3 of 4: Extracted Transformation Rules

Verdict
- Supported: the new pair (grid_1) supports the core hypothesis: non-blue shapes are ignored; crop to the minimal bounding box of blue cells (grid_size 4x4 here); recolor blue→green; express the pattern inside the crop as a network of straight primitives (horizontal/vertical/diagonal) and isolated points.
- Refinement confirmed: single-pixel connected components become isolated_point primitives in the output. The system continues to decompose strokes into short primitives (and may omit or split longer input runs) while preserving orientations and relative positions inside the crop.

Refined concise rule (final)
1. Remove all non-blue pixels. Compute the minimal bounding box around remaining blue pixels; that box becomes the output grid (coordinates are relative to the top-left of that crop).
2. Recolor all kept pixels from blue → green.
3. Represent the cropped pattern as a set of straight primitives: horizontal_line, vertical_line, diagonal_line, and isolated_point. Implementation details:
   - Preserve orientation of existing blue runs where possible, but decompose into short segments rather than forcing maximal single segments.
   - Single-pixel components inside the crop are output as isolated_point.
   - Small junction fixes (filling a pixel at a junction) are allowed if needed to form continuous straight strokes, but strokes may also be represented as several short primitives meeting at junctions.
4. Output primitives list contains all these green primitives with coordinates/lengths relative to the crop.

Primitives expected for this input (as observed)
- grid_size(output,4,4)
- horizontal_line(output,start(0,2),end(0,3),color(green),length(2))
- diagonal_line(output,start(2,2),end(3,3),color(green),length(2))
- isolated_point(output,(0,0),green)
- isolated_point(output,(3,0),green)
ITERATION 4 of 4: Extracted Transformation Rules

Verdict
- Supported: grid_0 broadly supports the prior core hypothesis (ignore non-blue, crop to blue bounding box, recolor blue→green, express pattern as straight primitives).
- Refinement/extension required: this case shows the system also actively connects and sometimes extends strokes inside the crop to form continuous straight lines (sometimes spanning the crop edge-to-edge). As a result, some isolated blue pixels can be absorbed into newly created strokes (and thus disappear as isolated_point), while other single pixels that remain disconnected are output as isolated_point.

Refined concise rule (final)
1. Remove non-blue pixels. Compute minimal bounding box of remaining blue pixels; that bounding box is the output grid.
2. Recolor kept pixels blue→green.
3. Build an abstract network of straight primitives (horizontal_line, vertical_line, diagonal_line) plus isolated_point:
   - Preserve orientation of original blue runs (horizontal/vertical/diagonal), but decompose into short segments at junctions where convenient.
   - Where blue pixels suggest alignment (same row or same column) or a corner/junction, the transformer will often connect them into continuous straight primitives — and may extend those primitives to span across the crop (edge-to-edge) to form a clean grid-like stroke.
   - Single-pixel components: if they remain disconnected after the connection/extension step, output them as isolated_point; if they become part of a constructed stroke, they will not appear as isolated_point.
4. Output coordinates/lengths are relative to the crop (top-left of bounding box is (0,0)).

Primitives expected for this input (supported by grid_0)
- grid_size(output,4,4)
- diagonal_line(output,start(2,2),end(3,3),color(green),length(2))
- diagonal_line(output,start(3,1),end(2,2),color(green),length(2))
- diagonal_line(output,start(3,2),end(2,3),color(green),length(2))
- horizontal_line(output,start(2,2),end(2,3),color(green),length(2))
- horizontal_line(output,start(3,0),end(3,3),color(green),length(4))
- vertical_line(output,start(2,2),end(3,2),color(green),length(2))
- vertical_line(output,start(2,3),end(3,3),color(green),length(2))

Summary
- Core hypothesis upheld. Add: the system sometimes actively completes/extends strokes inside the crop to form continuous, often edge-spanning, lines; isolated pixels may be absorbed or kept depending on whether they participate in those constructed strokes.

Natural-language description

1. Removed all non-blue pixels from the input and computed the minimal bounding box of the remaining blue pixels; the crop is 4 rows × 4 columns (rows 0..3, cols 0..3) — grid_size(output,4,4).
2. Recolored the kept pixels from blue to green.
3. Within the crop the transformer connected and extended strokes to form straight primitives:
   - a full horizontal stroke across the bottom row (row 3, cols 0→3),
   - a small horizontal segment at row 2, cols 2→3,
   - vertical segments at cols 2 and 3 covering rows 2→3,
   - and three short diagonal segments that create the corner/junction geometry in the lower‑right (diagonals between (2,2),(3,3), (3,1),(2,2) and (3,2),(2,3)).
4. The original isolated blue pixel at (3,0) was absorbed into the extended bottom horizontal line; no isolated_point primitives remain. Coordinates are given relative to the crop with top-left = (0,0).
