ITERATION 1 of 3: Extracted Transformation Rules

Observed rules mapping input -> output:

1. Merge isolated cyan points that share a row into a single horizontal line spanning their min..max columns; similarly merge points that share a column into a single vertical line spanning their min..max rows. Color is preserved.
2. At every cell where a horizontal and a vertical cyan line meet (an intersection), add a 2-cell cyan diagonal that connects the two cells one step outward along the horizontal and vertical directions from the intersection (i.e., the horizontal neighbor and the vertical neighbor that lie away from the junction).
3. Any isolated input point not collinear with others remains an isolated point in the output.
4. Grid size preserved.

Primitives produced (as in the output):
- grid_size(output,10,10)
- vertical_line(output,start(1,1),end(4,1),color(cyan),length(4))
- horizontal_line(output,start(1,1),end(1,5),color(cyan),length(5))
- vertical_line(output,start(1,5),end(7,5),color(cyan),length(7))
- horizontal_line(output,start(7,5),end(7,9),color(cyan),length(5))
- diagonal_line(output,start(2,1),end(1,2),color(cyan),length(2))  (at intersection (1,1))
- diagonal_line(output,start(1,4),end(2,5),color(cyan),length(2))  (at intersection (1,5))
- diagonal_line(output,start(6,5),end(7,6),color(cyan),length(2))  (at intersection (7,5))
- isolated_point(output,(9,2),cyan)
ITERATION 2 of 3: Extracted Transformation Rules

Conclusion
- The new input-output pair (grid_1) supports the prior rules — no contradictions found.

Refined rule set (concise)
1. Collinear merging: All isolated cyan points that share the same row are merged into a single horizontal cyan line spanning the minimum to maximum column indices of those points; similarly, points sharing the same column are merged into a single vertical cyan line spanning the minimum to maximum row indices. Color preserved; endpoints are the min/max coordinates of the original points.
2. Intersection diagonals: Wherever a horizontal and a vertical cyan line intersect, add a 2-cell cyan diagonal that connects the two cells adjacent to the intersection along each line, taking the neighbor cell that lies one step away from the intersection in the direction that continues along that line segment (i.e., toward the interior/continuation of each segment). The diagonal connects those two neighbor cells and has length 2.
3. Isolated non-collinear points: Any input point not collinear with any other input points remains an isolated point in the output (color preserved).
4. Grid size is preserved.

Predicted primitives present in the output for the new input (grid_1)
- grid_size(output,10,10)
- horizontal_line(output,start(6,5),end(6,9),color(cyan),length(5))
- vertical_line(output,start(3,2),end(8,2),color(cyan),length(6))
- isolated_point(output,(1,7),cyan)

(No intersection diagonals are produced here because the created horizontal and vertical lines do not intersect.)
ITERATION 3 of 3: Extracted Transformation Rules

Verdict
- The new input-output pair (grid_0) supports the prior rules — no contradictions. It matches collinear merging, endpoint-based diagonals at intersections, preservation of isolated non-collinear points, and preserved grid size.

Refined rule set (concise)
1. Collinear merging (unchanged)
   - All input cyan points that lie on the same row become a single horizontal cyan line from the minimum to maximum column index (inclusive).
   - All input cyan points that lie on the same column become a single vertical cyan line from the minimum to maximum row index (inclusive).
   - Color is preserved.

2. Intersection diagonals (refined)
   - For every cell where a horizontal and a vertical cyan line meet (i.e., they share a cell), create a 2-cell cyan diagonal that connects the two cells adjacent to the intersection along each line.
   - For each line, choose the adjacent cell that is one step away from the intersection toward the interior of that segment (i.e., toward the line's other cells / away from the intersection if the intersection is an endpoint). The diagonal connects those two adjacent cells; length = 2.
   - This produces a short diagonal “corner” at the L-shaped meeting of the lines (orientation determined by which side of the intersection the two adjacent cells lie).

3. Isolated points (unchanged)
   - Any input point not collinear with any other input points remains an isolated cyan point in the output.

4. Grid size (unchanged)
   - Grid size is preserved.

Predicted/practical primitives for the new input (grid_0)
- grid_size(output,10,10)
- horizontal_line(output,start(3,1),end(3,6),color(cyan),length(6))
- vertical_line(output,start(3,6),end(9,6),color(cyan),length(7))
- diagonal_line(output,start(3,5),end(4,6),color(cyan),length(2))
- isolated_point(output,(7,4),cyan)

STEP 4: Predicted Test Output

Answer — primitives and short description

Primitives:
- grid_size(output,10,10)
- horizontal_line(output,start(8,4),end(8,7),color(cyan),length(4))
- vertical_line(output,start(1,1),end(5,1),color(cyan),length(5))
- vertical_line(output,start(3,7),end(8,7),color(cyan),length(6))
- diagonal_line(output,start(8,6),end(7,7),color(cyan),length(2))
- isolated_point(output,(2,3),cyan)

Natural-language description:
- The 10x10 grid is preserved.
- Input cyan points that shared a row or column were merged into continuous cyan lines: a horizontal line at row 8 spanning columns 4–7, a vertical line at column 1 spanning rows 1–5, and a vertical line at column 7 spanning rows 3–8.
- Where the horizontal (row 8) and vertical (col 7) lines meet at (8,7), a 2-cell cyan diagonal was added connecting the cells one step inward along each line: (8,6) — (7,7).
- Any input point not collinear with others remains isolated: (2,3) remains a single cyan point.
