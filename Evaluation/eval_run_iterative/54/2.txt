ITERATION 1 of 3: Extracted Transformation Rules

Observations / rules:
- Grid size unchanged: 10x10.
- Collinear cyan isolated points are connected into continuous lines: if two or more cyan points share a row, create a horizontal line spanning from the minimum to maximum column; if they share a column, create a vertical line spanning from the minimum to maximum row.
- At each intersection cell where a cyan horizontal and a cyan vertical line meet, add a 2-cell cyan diagonal that connects the two neighbor cells one step along each line away from the intersection (i.e., the diagonal between the adjacent horizontal neighbor and the adjacent vertical neighbor).
- Any input cyan point not lying on any created line remains an isolated cyan point.
- Color preserved (cyan).

Predicted output primitives (as given):
- grid_size(output,10,10)
- vertical_line(output,start(1,1),end(4,1),color(cyan),length(4))
- horizontal_line(output,start(1,1),end(1,5),color(cyan),length(5))
- vertical_line(output,start(1,5),end(7,5),color(cyan),length(7))
- horizontal_line(output,start(7,5),end(7,9),color(cyan),length(5))
- diagonal_line(output,start(2,1),end(1,2),color(cyan),length(2))  (corner at (1,1))
- diagonal_line(output,start(1,4),end(2,5),color(cyan),length(2))  (corner at (1,5))
- diagonal_line(output,start(6,5),end(7,6),color(cyan),length(2))  (corner at (7,5))
- isolated_point(output,(9,2),cyan)
ITERATION 2 of 3: Extracted Transformation Rules

Conclusion: the new pair (grid_1) supports and does not contradict the previously inferred rules. Refinements and concise rule set:

- Grid size is preserved.
- Line formation:
  - If two or more cyan input points share the same row, create one cyan horizontal line spanning from the minimum to maximum column (inclusive).
  - If two or more cyan input points share the same column, create one cyan vertical line spanning from the minimum to maximum row (inclusive).
- Diagonals at intersections:
  - For every cell where a created cyan horizontal and a created cyan vertical line cross, add a 2-cell cyan diagonal that connects the two adjacent cells one step into each line from the intersection (i.e., the horizontal neighbor one cell along the horizontal line toward the interior of that horizontal segment, and the vertical neighbor one cell along the vertical line toward the interior of that vertical segment). The diagonal thus links those two adjacent interior neighbors (length 2).
  - If there is no intersection of created horizontal and vertical lines, no diagonals are added.
- Any input cyan point that does not lie on any created line remains an isolated cyan point in the output.
- Color preserved (cyan).

Expected output primitives (per these rules) for the new input:
- grid_size(output,10,10)
- horizontal_line(output,start(6,5),end(6,9),color(cyan),length(5))
- vertical_line(output,start(3,2),end(8,2),color(cyan),length(6))
- isolated_point(output,(1,7),cyan)

No contradictions found.
ITERATION 3 of 3: Extracted Transformation Rules

Conclusion: the new pair (grid_0) supports and does not contradict the previously inferred rules. No changes to the rule set are required; only a small clarification about how the diagonal endpoints are chosen.

Refined concise rule set
- Grid size is preserved.
- Line formation:
  - If two or more cyan input points share the same row, create one cyan horizontal line spanning from the minimum to maximum column (inclusive).
  - If two or more cyan input points share the same column, create one cyan vertical line spanning from the minimum to maximum row (inclusive).
- Diagonals at intersections:
  - For every cell where a created cyan horizontal and a created cyan vertical line cross, add a 2-cell cyan diagonal that connects the two cells that are each one step from the intersection toward the interior of their respective segments. (I.e., take the horizontal neighbor one cell along the horizontal segment toward its interior/middle, and the vertical neighbor one cell along the vertical segment toward its interior; draw the 2-cell diagonal joining those two neighbors.)
- Isolated points:
  - Any input cyan point that does not lie on any created horizontal or vertical line remains an isolated cyan point in the output.
- Color preserved (cyan).

Expected output primitives for the new input (grid_0) under these rules
- grid_size(output,10,10)
- horizontal_line(output,start(3,1),end(3,6),color(cyan),length(6))
- vertical_line(output,start(3,6),end(9,6),color(cyan),length(7))
- diagonal_line(output,start(3,5),end(4,6),color(cyan),length(2))
- isolated_point(output,(7,4),cyan)

No contradictions found.

STEP 4: Predicted Test Output

Answer applying the refined rule set to the given input grid:

Output primitives
- grid_size(output,10,10)
- horizontal_line(output,start(8,4),end(8,7),color(cyan),length(4))
- vertical_line(output,start(1,1),end(5,1),color(cyan),length(5))
- vertical_line(output,start(3,7),end(8,7),color(cyan),length(6))
- diagonal_line(output,start(7,7),end(8,6),color(cyan),length(2))
- isolated_point(output,(2,3),cyan)

Natural-language description of the result
- The 10x10 grid is preserved.
- A horizontal cyan line is drawn on row 8 from column 4 through column 7 (because input had two points at (8,4) and (8,7)).
- Two vertical cyan lines are drawn: one in column 1 from row 1 to row 5 (points at (1,1) and (5,1)), and one in column 7 from row 3 to row 8 (points at (3,7) and (8,7)).
- The horizontal and the column-7 vertical intersect at (8,7); following the rule, we add the 2-cell cyan diagonal joining the horizontal neighbor toward the interior (8,6) and the vertical neighbor toward the interior (7,7) — represented as the diagonal from (7,7) to (8,6).
- Any input point not on any created horizontal/vertical line remains isolated: (2,3) stays as an isolated cyan point.
