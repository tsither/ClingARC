ITERATION 1 of 8: Extracted Transformation Rules

Rule:
- For each pair of cyan isolated points that share the same row or the same column, draw a green line filling exactly the cells strictly between them (start = min+1, end = max-1). Leave the original cyan points unchanged. Cyan points without an aligned partner remain as points.

Primitives produced:
- grid_size(output,12,11)
- cyan points (unchanged): point(output,(1,3),cyan), point(output,(4,6),cyan), point(output,(4,10),cyan), point(output,(5,1),cyan), point(output,(9,3),cyan)
- horizontal_line(output,start(4,7),end(4,9),color(green),length(3))  — fills between (4,6) and (4,10)
- vertical_line(output,start(2,3),end(8,3),color(green),length(7))    — fills between (1,3) and (9,3)
ITERATION 2 of 8: Extracted Transformation Rules

Conclusion: the new pair supports and refines the previous rule.

Refined rule:
- Preserve grid size and keep all input cyan points unchanged in the output.
- For any two or more cyan points that share the same row or the same column, draw a single green line filling exactly the cells strictly between the minimum and maximum coordinates on that row/column (start = min + 1, end = max - 1). This produces a horizontal or vertical green line spanning the interior cells between the extreme aligned cyan points.
- Cyan points that have no other cyan point aligned in their row or column remain as isolated points.

Primitives expected in outputs:
- grid_size(output, same as input)
- point(output, (x,y), cyan) for every input cyan point
- horizontal_line(output, start(row,min_col+1), end(row,max_col-1), color(green), length = max_col-min_col-1) for each row with ≥2 cyan points
- vertical_line(output, start(min_row+1,col), end(max_row-1,col), color(green), length = max_row-min_row-1) for each column with ≥2 cyan points

Example from new pair: vertical_line(output,start(2,2),end(6,2),color(green),length(5)) between (1,2) and (7,2).
ITERATION 3 of 8: Extracted Transformation Rules

Conclusion: the new pair (grid_2) supports and confirms the previously derived rule without contradiction.

Refined rule (final):
- Preserve grid size and preserve every input cyan point as a cyan point in the output.
- For any row that contains ≥2 cyan points, draw one horizontal green line filling exactly the interior cells strictly between the leftmost and rightmost cyan points on that row (start_col = min_col+1, end_col = max_col-1, length = max_col - min_col - 1). Do not overwrite the cyan endpoints.
- For any column that contains ≥2 cyan points, draw one vertical green line filling exactly the interior cells strictly between the topmost and bottommost cyan points in that column (start_row = min_row+1, end_row = max_row-1, length = max_row - min_row - 1). Do not overwrite the cyan endpoints.
- Multiple rows/columns may be processed independently (multiple green lines allowed). Lines are green; preserved points remain cyan.

Primitives expected in outputs:
- grid_size(output, same as input)
- point(output,(r,c),cyan) for every input cyan point
- horizontal_line(output,start(r,min_col+1),end(r,max_col-1),color(green),length=max_col-min_col-1) for each row with ≥2 cyan points
- vertical_line(output,start(min_row+1,c),end(max_row-1,c),color(green),length=max_row-min_row-1) for each column with ≥2 cyan points
ITERATION 4 of 8: Extracted Transformation Rules

Supported — the new pair (grid_6) is consistent with and confirms the previously derived rule.

Refined rule (final, unchanged except for explicit interior-length condition):
- Preserve grid size and preserve every input cyan point as a cyan point in the output.
- For any row that contains ≥2 cyan points and has at least one interior cell between leftmost and rightmost cyan points (max_col - min_col - 1 ≥ 1), draw a horizontal green line filling exactly the interior cells strictly between them (start_col = min_col+1, end_col = max_col-1, length = max_col - min_col - 1). Do not overwrite the cyan endpoints.
- For any column that contains ≥2 cyan points and has at least one interior cell between topmost and bottommost cyan points (max_row - min_row - 1 ≥ 1), draw a vertical green line filling exactly the interior cells strictly between them (start_row = min_row+1, end_row = max_row-1, length = max_row - min_row - 1). Do not overwrite the cyan endpoints.
- Rows and columns are processed independently; multiple green lines may appear. Lines are green; preserved points remain cyan.

Expected primitives in outputs:
- grid_size(output, same as input)
- point(output,(r,c),cyan) for every input cyan point
- horizontal_line(output,start(r,min_col+1),end(r,max_col-1),color(green),length=max_col-min_col-1) for each row with ≥2 cyan points and length≥1
- vertical_line(output,start(min_row+1,c),end(max_row-1,c),color(green),length=max_row-min_row-1) for each column with ≥2 cyan points and length≥1

Example from grid_6: column 3 has cyan at (1,3) and (6,3) → vertical_line(start(2,3),end(5,3),color(green),length=4); other rows/columns unchanged.
ITERATION 5 of 8: Extracted Transformation Rules

Conclusion: Supported — the new pair (grid_1) matches and confirms the previously derived rule. No change to the rule is needed.

Reasoning (concise):
- Column 4 has cyan at rows 1 and 7 → interior rows 2..6 → vertical green line start(2,4) end(6,4) length 5.
- Column 8 has cyan at rows 2 and 6 → interior rows 3..5 → vertical green line start(3,8) end(5,8) length 3.
- There are no rows with ≥2 cyan points, so no horizontal green lines are drawn.
- All input cyan points are preserved.

Final refined rule (unchanged, explicit interior condition):
- Preserve grid size and every input cyan point as cyan in output.
- For any row with ≥2 cyan points and interior length (max_col - min_col - 1) ≥ 1, draw a horizontal green line filling exactly the interior cells between them (start_col = min_col+1, end_col = max_col-1, length = max_col - min_col - 1). Do not overwrite cyan endpoints.
- For any column with ≥2 cyan points and interior length (max_row - min_row - 1) ≥ 1, draw a vertical green line filling exactly the interior cells between them (start_row = min_row+1, end_row = max_row-1, length = max_row - min_row - 1). Do not overwrite cyan endpoints.
- Rows and columns processed independently; multiple green lines allowed.

- point(output,(2,8),cyan)
- point(output,(6,8),cyan)
- point(output,(7,4),cyan)
- vertical_line(output,start(2,4),end(6,4),color(green),length(5))
- vertical_line(output,start(3,8),end(5,8),color(green),length(3))
ITERATION 6 of 8: Extracted Transformation Rules

Conclusion: Supported — the new pair (grid_5) matches the previously derived rule. No change to the rule is needed.

Reasoning (brief):
- The two cyan points are in different rows and different columns, so no row or column has ≥2 cyan points. Therefore no green horizontal or vertical lines are drawn. All cyan points are preserved.

Predicted primitives for this input (grid_5):
- grid_size(output,5,6)
- isolated_point(output,(1,1),cyan)
- isolated_point(output,(3,4),cyan)

Rule reminder (unchanged):
- Preserve grid size and every input cyan point in the output.
- For any row with ≥2 cyan points, draw a horizontal green line filling exactly the interior cells between the leftmost and rightmost cyan points (do not overwrite cyan endpoints).
- For any column with ≥2 cyan points, draw a vertical green line filling exactly the interior cells between the topmost and bottommost cyan points (do not overwrite cyan endpoints).
- Rows and columns processed independently; multiple green lines allowed.
ITERATION 7 of 8: Extracted Transformation Rules

Conclusion: Supported. The new pair (grid_4) matches the previous rule; no change needed.

Reason: The input has a single cyan point so no row or column contains ≥2 cyan points, therefore no green horizontal or vertical lines are added and the cyan point is preserved.

Predicted output primitives for grid_4:
- grid_size(output,3,3)
- isolated_point(output,(1,1),cyan)

Rule (unchanged):
- Preserve grid size and every input cyan point in the output.
- For any row with ≥2 cyan cyan points, draw a green horizontal line filling exactly the interior cells between the leftmost and rightmost cyan points (do not overwrite cyan endpoints).
- For any column with ≥2 cyan points, draw a green vertical line filling exactly the interior cells between the topmost and bottommost cyan points (do not overwrite cyan endpoints).
- Rows and columns processed independently; multiple green lines allowed.

STEP 4: Predicted Test Output

Output primitives:
- grid_size(output,12,13)
- point(output,(1,2),cyan)
- point(output,(1,10),cyan)
- point(output,(5,6),cyan)
- point(output,(5,12),cyan)
- point(output,(7,1),cyan)
- point(output,(9,8),cyan)
- point(output,(10,1),cyan)
- horizontal_line(output,start(1,3),end(1,9),color(green),length(7))
- horizontal_line(output,start(5,7),end(5,11),color(green),length(5))
- vertical_line(output,start(8,1),end(9,1),color(green),length(2))

Natural-language description:
- Grid size is preserved (12 rows × 13 columns). All input cyan points are retained at the same coordinates.
- Row 1 had two cyan endpoints at columns 2 and 10, so a green horizontal line fills the interior cells from (1,3) to (1,9) (7 cells).
- Row 5 had cyan endpoints at columns 6 and 12, so a green horizontal line fills the interior cells from (5,7) to (5,11) (5 cells).
- Column 1 had cyan endpoints at rows 7 and 10, so a green vertical line fills the interior cells from (8,1) to (9,1) (2 cells).
- No other rows or columns contain ≥2 cyan points, so no additional green lines are added.
