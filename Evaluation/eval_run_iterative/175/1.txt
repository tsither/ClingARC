ITERATION 1 of 8: Extracted Transformation Rules

Observed rule:
- Preserve all original cyan isolated points.
- For any two cyan points that share the same row, draw a green horizontal line occupying the cells strictly between their columns (start = min.col+1, end = max.col-1).
- For any two cyan points that share the same column, draw a green vertical line occupying the cells strictly between their rows (start = min.row+1, end = max.row-1).

Primitives present in the output (given the input points):
- grid_size(output,12,11)
- preserved cyan points: point(output,(1,3),cyan), point(output,(4,6),cyan), point(output,(4,10),cyan), point(output,(5,1),cyan), point(output,(9,3),cyan)
- horizontal_line(output,start(4,7),end(4,9),color(green),length(3))  (between cyan at (4,6) and (4,10))
- vertical_line(output,start(2,3),end(8,3),color(green),length(7))    (between cyan at (1,3) and (9,3))
ITERATION 2 of 8: Extracted Transformation Rules

Conclusion: The new pair (grid_3) supports and does not contradict the previously inferred rule. No change of sign; refine wording slightly for clarity.

Refined rule:
- Keep all original cyan isolated points unchanged in the output.
- For each row that contains ≥2 cyan points, draw a green horizontal line filling the cells strictly between the leftmost and rightmost cyan points on that row (start = leftmost.col+1, end = rightmost.col-1).
- For each column that contains ≥2 cyan points, draw a green vertical line filling the cells strictly between the topmost and bottommost cyan points on that column (start = topmost.row+1, end = bottommost.row-1).

Primitives expected in this new case (grid_3):
- grid_size(output,9,6)
- preserved cyan points: point(output,(1,2),cyan), point(output,(7,2),cyan)
- vertical_line(output,start(2,2),end(6,2),color(green),length(5)) (cells strictly between rows 1 and 7 in column 2)
ITERATION 3 of 8: Extracted Transformation Rules

Conclusion: The new pair (grid_2) supports the previously inferred rule — it does not contradict it. No change to the logical rule is needed; wording slightly tightened below.

Refined rule (final):
- Preserve all cyan isolated points in the output as cyan points (same coordinates).
- For any row that contains ≥ 2 cyan points, draw a green horizontal line filling the cells strictly between the leftmost and rightmost cyan points on that row (start column = leftmost.col + 1, end column = rightmost.col - 1). Color = green.
- For any column that contains ≥ 2 cyan points, draw a green vertical line filling the cells strictly between the topmost and bottommost cyan points in that column (start row = topmost.row + 1, end row = bottommost.row - 1). Color = green.
- Do not draw lines for rows/columns with fewer than 2 cyan points. Lines are exclusive of the cyan endpoints.

Supported — the new pair (grid_6) matches the existing rule; no change required.

Restated rule (concise):
- Keep all cyan isolated points at their same coordinates in the output.

STEP 4: Predicted Test Output

Explanation of application of the rule
- All cyan points from the input are preserved at their same coordinates in the output.
- Row 1 contains cyan at (1,2) and (1,10) → draw a green horizontal line on row 1 covering the cells strictly between them: columns 3..9.
- Row 5 contains cyan at (5,6) and (5,12) → draw a green horizontal line on row 5 covering columns 7..11.
- Column 1 contains cyan at (7,1) and (10,1) → draw a green vertical line in column 1 covering the rows strictly between them: rows 8..9.
- No other rows or columns have ≥2 cyan points, so no other green lines are added.
