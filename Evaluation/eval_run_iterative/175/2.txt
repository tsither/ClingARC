ITERATION 1 of 8: Extracted Transformation Rules

Rule:
- Preserve all original cyan points.
- For any two cyan points that share the same column, draw a green vertical line covering the cells strictly between them (exclusive of the cyan endpoints).
- For any two cyan points that share the same row, draw a green horizontal line covering the cells strictly between them (exclusive of the cyan endpoints).
- Leave cyan points that are not aligned with any other cyan unchanged.

Predicted output primitives:
- grid_size(output,12,11)
- isolated_point/output points retained: (1,3) cyan, (4,6) cyan, (4,10) cyan, (5,1) cyan, (9,3) cyan
- vertical_line(output,start(2,3),end(8,3),color(green),length(7))  (connects cyan points at (1,3) and (9,3) excluding endpoints)
- horizontal_line(output,start(4,7),end(4,9),color(green),length(3)) (connects cyan points at (4,6) and (4,10) excluding endpoints)
ITERATION 2 of 8: Extracted Transformation Rules

Conclusion: the new pair supports and slightly refines the prior rule.

Refined rule (concise)
- Preserve all original cyan points in place.
- For any set of two or more cyan points that share the same column, draw a single green vertical line filling all cells strictly between the minimum and maximum cyan row indices in that column (endpoints exclusive).
- For any set of two or more cyan points that share the same row, draw a single green horizontal line filling all cells strictly between the minimum and maximum cyan column indices in that row (endpoints exclusive).
- Do not draw diagonal lines; do not remove or recolor the cyan endpoints.
- Grid size remains unchanged.

Predicted primitives for the new input (matches observed output)
- grid_size(output,9,6)
- point(output,(1,2),cyan)
- point(output,(7,2),cyan)
- vertical_line(output,start(2,2),end(6,2),color(green),length(5))
ITERATION 3 of 8: Extracted Transformation Rules

Assessment: The new pair (grid_2) supports and slightly refines the prior rule — no contradiction.

Refined rule (concise)
- Preserve all cyan points in place; do not recolor or remove them.
- If two or more cyan points share the same column, add a single green vertical line filling every cell strictly between the minimum and maximum cyan row indices in that column (endpoints exclusive).
- If two or more cyan points share the same row, add a single green horizontal line filling every cell strictly between the minimum and maximum cyan column indices in that row (endpoints exclusive).
- Do not create diagonal lines or additional lines for single isolated cyan points.
- Grid size unchanged.

Refined rule (concise)
- Grid size remains unchanged.
- Preserve every cyan point at its original coordinate in the output (do not recolor or remove them).
- For any column that contains two or more cyan points, add one green vertical line that fills every cell strictly between the minimum and maximum cyan row indices in that column (endpoints exclusive). The line's start and end are the first and last filled cells between those endpoints.
- For any row that contains two or more cyan points, add one green horizontal line that fills every cell strictly between the minimum and maximum cyan column indices in that row (endpoints exclusive).
- Do not draw lines for single isolated cyan points. No diagonal lines are produced.
- Lines are colored green.

Result: Supported — the new pair (grid_1) agrees with and refines the prior rule; no contradiction.

Refined rule (concise)
- Grid size is unchanged.
- All cyan points from the input are preserved at the same coordinates in the output.
- For any column containing two or more cyan points, draw a green vertical line filling every cell strictly between the minimum and maximum cyan row indices in that column. Equivalently: start_row = min_row + 1, end_row = max_row - 1 (inclusive). Do not overwrite the cyan endpoint cells.
- For any row containing two or more cyan points, draw a green horizontal line filling every cell strictly between the minimum and maximum cyan column indices in that row. Equivalently: start_col = min_col + 1, end_col = max_col - 1 (inclusive). Do not overwrite the cyan endpoint cells.

- point(output,(9,8),cyan)
- point(output,(10,1),cyan)

Horizontal green lines (rows with ≥2 cyan points):
- horizontal_line(output,start(1,3),end(1,9),color(green),length(7))  (row 1, covers columns 3..9 between cyan points at (1,2) and (1,10))
- horizontal_line(output,start(5,7),end(5,11),color(green),length(5)) (row 5, covers columns 7..11 between cyan points at (5,6) and (5,12))

Vertical green lines (columns with ≥2 cyan points):
- vertical_line(output,start(8,1),end(9,1),color(green),length(2)) (column 1, covers rows 8..9 between cyan points at (7,1) and (10,1))

Description: grid size remains 12x13. All cyan input points are preserved at their original coordinates. A green horizontal line fills the interior cells strictly between the two cyan points on row 1 and similarly on row 5. A green vertical line fills the interior cells strictly between the two cyan points in column 1. No other cells are changed.
