ITERATION 1 of 2: Extracted Transformation Rules

Summary of observed mapping rules (concise):

- Grid size unchanged: 6x6.

- Cyan vertical line:
  - Extend the input cyan column so it occupies the entire column except at the row containing the red horizontal. This splits it into two vertical segments: one above the red row and one below it.
  - At the red-row crossing cell, remove cyan and place a yellow point instead.

- Red horizontal line:
  - Keep the right endpoint fixed; extend the horizontal leftwards until it starts immediately to the right of the cyan column (i.e., begins at the column right of the yellow). This increases its length while preserving row and right end.
  - Any remaining cells to the left of the cyan column on that row are filled/marked starting with a red point at the far left (here only (3,0)).

Predicted output primitives (as observed):
- grid_size(output,6,6)
- horizontal_line(output,start(3,2),end(3,5),color(red),length(4))
- point(output,(3,0),red)
- point(output,(3,1),yellow)  (yellow replaces cyan at the crossing)
- vertical_line(output,start(0,1),end(2,1),color(cyan),length(3))
- vertical_line(output,start(4,1),end(5,1),color(cyan),length(2))
ITERATION 2 of 2: Extracted Transformation Rules

Verdict
- The new pair supports most of the prior pattern for the cyan column and the yellow crossing, but it contradicts the earlier claim that the red horizontal "keeps the right endpoint fixed." The red endpoint is not preserved; instead the horizontal is extended toward the cyan column until it becomes adjacent to it.

Refined rules (concise)
- Grid size unchanged.
- Cyan vertical column:
  - Extend the input cyan column to fill the column above and below the row containing the red horizontal, producing (if needed) two vertical segments: one from the top down to just above the red row, and one from just below the red row to the bottom.
  - At the red horizontal's row cell in the cyan column, remove cyan and place a yellow point.
- Red horizontal:
  - Expand the red horizontal along its row toward the cyan column (leftwards or rightwards depending on which side the red originally lies) until the horizontal ends at the cell immediately adjacent to the cyan column (i.e., the cell directly next to the cyan column on that side). The horizontal does not cross the cyan column.
  - Place a single red point at the far extreme cell on the opposite side of the cyan column (the row's far-edge cell not occupied by the extended horizontal or the cyan column).  
- Colors: yellow appears only at the cyan-column × red-row crossing; cyan occupies the two vertical segments; red occupies the contiguous horizontal run adjacent to cyan plus the one far-edge red point.

Predicted output primitives for this input (grid_0)
- grid_size(output,6,6)
- vertical_line(output,start(0,4),end(1,4),color(cyan),length(2))  (top segment preserved)
- vertical_line(output,start(3,4),end(5,4),color(cyan),length(3))  (bottom segment created)
- point(output,(2,4),yellow)  (cyan × red row replaced by yellow)
- horizontal_line(output,start(2,0),end(2,3),color(red),length(4))  (red expanded to be adjacent to cyan at col4)
- point(output,(2,5),red)  (single red at the far opposite edge)

These primitives match the observed output for the new pair and resolve the earlier incorrect assumption about preserving the red right endpoint.

STEP 4: Predicted Test Output

Output primitives
- grid_size(output,6,6)
- vertical_line(output,start(0,3),end(3,3),color(cyan),length(4))
- vertical_line(output,start(5,3),end(5,3),color(cyan),length(1))
- point(output,(4,3),yellow)
- horizontal_line(output,start(4,0),end(4,2),color(red),length(3))
- point(output,(4,5),red)

Natural-language description
The 6×6 grid is unchanged in size. The cyan column at x=3 is extended so it forms two segments: a top segment from (0,3) down to just above the red row at (3,3), and a bottom fragment at (5,3) below the red row. The cyan cell at the red row (4,3) is replaced by a single yellow point. The red horizontal on row 4 is expanded rightward so it runs contiguously from (4,0) to (4,2), stopping immediately adjacent to the cyan column, and a single red point is placed at the far-right edge at (4,5).
