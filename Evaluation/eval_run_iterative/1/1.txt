ITERATION 1 of 4: Extracted Transformation Rules

Observations / rule:
- Find the cell where the two gray diagonals intersect (the only cell with degree 2). Color the entire row containing that intersection green (full horizontal line).
- Color every other row yellow (full horizontal lines).
- Grid size is preserved.

Primitives predicted for the output:
- grid_size(output,3,3)
- horizontal_line(output,start(0,0),end(0,2),color(yellow),length(3))
- horizontal_line(output,start(1,0),end(1,2),color(green),length(3))
- horizontal_line(output,start(2,0),end(2,2),color(yellow),length(3))
ITERATION 2 of 4: Extracted Transformation Rules

Conclusion:
- The new pair contradicts the previous specific color assignment (previous rule said the intersection row is always green and other rows yellow). In the new example the intersection row is yellow and the other rows are red.
- Refined/general rule supported by all examples:
  - Locate the unique intersection cell of the two gray diagonals (the only cell with degree 2). Let its row be R.
  - Fill the entire row R with a single color (a full horizontal line).
  - Fill every other row with a second single color (the same color for all non-intersection rows).
  - Preserve grid size and full-row horizontals spanning the grid width.

Predicted output primitives (parameterized by the input):
- grid_size(output, W, H) (same as input)
- horizontal_line(output, start(0,0), end(0,W-1), color = C_other, length = W) for every row i ≠ R
- horizontal_line(output, start(R,0), end(R,W-1), color = C_intersection, length = W)
- C_intersection ≠ C_other (specific color labels vary between examples and are not consistently mapped from input)
ITERATION 3 of 4: Extracted Transformation Rules

Summary:
- The new pair (single full vertical gray line → full green square) contradicts the idea that every input maps to the "two-diagonals → horizontal bands" transformation. It therefore requires splitting into two separate transformation rules depending on the input primitives.

Refined rules (covering all seen examples):
1. Case A — Two gray diagonals that intersect (an X):
   - Locate the unique intersection cell (the cell with degree 2). Let its row be R.
   - Output keeps the same grid_size(W,H).
   - Output contains a full horizontal_line across every row (start(row,0) to end(row,W-1)).
   - The row R is filled with one color (C_intersection); every other row is filled with a single, different color (C_other).
   - C_intersection ≠ C_other. Color labels vary between examples and are not deterministically derived from input color(s).

   Predicted output primitives for this case:
   - grid_size(output, W, H)
   - horizontal_line(output, start(R,0), end(R,W-1), color=C_intersection, length=W)
   - horizontal_line(output, start(i,0), end(i,W-1), color=C_other, length=W) for all i ≠ R

2. Case B — Single vertical line spanning full grid height:
   - Output keeps the same grid_size(W,H).
   - Output is a filled square covering the whole grid (top_left_corner(0,0) to bottom_right_corner(H-1,W-1)) with a single color (C_fill).
   - Color mapping is not reliably inferred from input color from the examples (input gray → output green here).

   Predicted output primitives for this case:
   - grid_size(output, W, H)
   - square(output, top_left_corner(0,0), bottom_right_corner(H-1,W-1), size=H (or W), color=C_fill)

Notes:
- Colors across examples are inconsistent and should be treated as example-specific (no deterministic mapping inferred).
- The presence/absence and types of input primitives (two diagonals intersecting vs. a full vertical line) determine which transformation rule applies.
ITERATION 4 of 4: Extracted Transformation Rules

Short answer: The new single full diagonal example supports and expands the diagonal→horizontal-bands pattern from before — it shows that not only intersecting diagonals but also a single full diagonal map to full horizontal rows. It contradicts the narrower hypothesis that only the two-diagonals (X/V) case produces horizontal bands.

Refined rule set (concise):

1) Diagonal-based → horizontal full-row bands
- Trigger: input contains diagonal_line primitives.
- Effect: output is grid_size(W,H) plus horizontal_line across every row (start(row,0) to end(row,W-1)).
- Color arrangement depends on the diagonal configuration:
  - Case 1A — Two diagonals that intersect at a single cell (the previous "X/V" examples):
    - Let R be the intersection row.
    - Row R gets one color; every other row gets a second color.
    - The two non-intersection rows share the same color (top and bottom identical in 3x3).
  - Case 1B — A single diagonal spanning the full grid height (length = H):
    - Each row is drawn as a horizontal line and rows receive distinct colors (no repetition across rows in examples).
    - (Orientation of the diagonal does not change that full-row output occurs; color order may be example-specific.)
- Colors are not deterministically derived from input color(s) in observed examples.

2) Full vertical line spanning grid height → filled square
- Trigger: input contains a vertical_line covering all rows.
- Effect: output is grid_size(W,H) and a single filled square covering the whole grid (top_left (0,0) to bottom_right(H-1,W-1)).
- Output color is example-specific (not reliably predictable from input color).

Prediction of primitives for the new input (single full diagonal length=3):
- grid_size(output,3,3)
- horizontal_line(output,start(0,0),end(0,2),color=C0,length=3)
- horizontal_line(output,start(1,0),end(1,2),color=C1,length=3)
- horizontal_line(output,start(2,0),end(2,2),color=C2,length=3)
(where C0,C1,C2 are distinct colors (example: green,yellow,red) and exact mapping is not deterministic).

Notes:
- The new pair supports the general diagonal→rows mapping and forces splitting the earlier single-rule hypothesis into the two diagonal-cases above.
- Color assignments remain non-deterministic across examples.

Output grid:
 

========================================

STEP 4: Predicted Test Output

Answer summary:
- Rule applied: any diagonal_line in the input triggers conversion to full horizontal-row bands in the output. For a single (non-intersecting) diagonal we follow the "single diagonal" case: draw a horizontal full-width line on every row; assign distinct colors to each row (color mapping is not derivable from the input).
- The isolated_point in the input is ignored by the rule.

Output primitives:
- grid_size(output,3,3)
- horizontal_line(output,start(0,0),end(0,2),color(red),length(3))
- horizontal_line(output,start(1,0),end(1,2),color(green),length(3))
- horizontal_line(output,start(2,0),end(2,2),color(blue),length(3))

Natural-language description:
From the 3x3 input that contains a short diagonal and an isolated point, the model produces a 3x3 output where every row is filled by a horizontal line. Each row is a full-width horizontal band; colors are distinct per row (here chosen red, green, blue). The isolated input point does not affect the output.
