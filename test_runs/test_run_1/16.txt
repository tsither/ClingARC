Rule summary:
- Every primitive is translated down by 1 row (row + 1). Columns remain the same.
- Shape type, color, and length are preserved.

Formally, for each input primitive with start(r1,c1) and end(r2,c2):
- output primitive has the same type, color, and length, with start(r1+1,c1) and end(r2+1,c2).

This rule generates the shown outputs for all examples.
Input grid:
 point(input,(1,1),blue) vertical_line(input,start(0,0),end(1,0),color(red),length(2))

========================================

Rule application:
- Every input primitive is moved down by 1 row (row + 1); columns unchanged. Types, colors, and lengths preserved.

Output primitives:
- point(output,(2,1),blue).
- vertical_line(output,start(1,0),end(2,0),color(red),length(2)).

Natural-language description:
The single blue point at (1,1) in the input is moved to (2,1). The red vertical line that spanned (0,0)→(1,0) is moved down to span (1,0)→(2,0), keeping its length 2.
