ITERATION 1 of 2: Extracted Transformation Rules

Observations / rule:
- Grid size unchanged (9x9).
- Each isolated gray point at (r,c) is preserved as a gray point in the output.
- For each such gray point, add a blue 3x3 square centered on that point. That square has top_left (r-1,c-1) and bottom_right (r+1,c+1).

Predicted output primitives (from the four input points):
- point(output,(1,7),gray)
- point(output,(2,3),gray)
- point(output,(5,7),gray)
- point(output,(7,3),gray)
- square(output,top_left_corner(0,6),bottom_right_corner(2,8),size(3),color(blue))  // center (1,7)
- square(output,top_left_corner(1,2),bottom_right_corner(3,4),size(3),color(blue))  // center (2,3)
- square(output,top_left_corner(4,6),bottom_right_corner(6,8),size(3),color(blue))  // center (5,7)
- square(output,top_left_corner(6,2),bottom_right_corner(8,4),size(3),color(blue))  // center (7,3)
ITERATION 2 of 2: Extracted Transformation Rules

Conclusion: the new pair supports the previous rule and extends it.

Confirmed core rule
- Grid size unchanged.
- Each isolated gray point in the input is preserved as a gray point in the output.
- For each such gray point at (r,c) the output contains a blue 3×3 square centered on that point (top_left (r-1,c-1), bottom_right (r+1,c+1)).

Additional refinements from the new pair
- The solver sometimes represents those 3×3 squares explicitly (square primitive) and sometimes decomposes them into their border segments (horizontal_line, vertical_line) and short corner diagonals (diagonal_line).
- When two or more squares are adjacent or aligned, their border segments merge into longer contiguous lines (e.g., multiple vertical edges become a single vertical_line spanning the combined extent).
- Short diagonal segments appear at touching/adjacent corners, connecting square corners (these are small diagonals of length 2–3 in the example).

Predicted primitives to expect in outputs (given an input with N isolated gray points)
- point(output,(r,c),gray) for each input isolated gray point.
- For each (r,c), a blue 3×3 square centered at (r,c). This may appear either as:
  - square(output,top_left_corner(r-1,c-1),bottom_right_corner(r+1,c+1),size(3),color(blue))
  or
  - the equivalent set of border primitives: horizontal_line for the top and bottom edges, vertical_line for left and right edges, plus short diagonal_line segments at corners where produced by the decomposition.
- If squares overlap or line up, expect merged horizontal/vertical line primitives whose lengths equal the combined contiguous border length.

No contradictions found — the new pair refines representation/merging behavior but keeps the original mapping from gray points to centered blue 3×3 squares.

STEP 3: Retrieved Test Input Primitives

Input grid:
 grid_size(input,9,9) isolated_point(input,(1,1),gray) isolated_point(input,(2,7),gray) isolated_point(input,(4,3),gray) isolated_point(input,(7,1),gray) isolated_point(input,(7,5),gray)

Output grid:
 

========================================

STEP 4: Predicted Test Output

grid_size(output,9,9).

% Gray points preserved
point(output,(1,1),gray).
point(output,(2,7),gray).
point(output,(4,3),gray).
point(output,(7,1),gray).
point(output,(7,5),gray).

% Each isolated gray point is the center of a blue 3x3 square
square(output,top_left(0,0), bottom_right(2,2), size(3), color(blue)).   % centered at (1,1)
square(output,top_left(1,6), bottom_right(3,8), size(3), color(blue)).   % centered at (2,7)
square(output,top_left(3,2), bottom_right(5,4), size(3), color(blue)).   % centered at (4,3)
square(output,top_left(6,0), bottom_right(8,2), size(3), color(blue)).   % centered at (7,1)
square(output,top_left(6,4), bottom_right(8,6), size(3), color(blue)).   % centered at (7,5)

Description:
The output is the same 9×9 grid. Each isolated gray input point is preserved at the same coordinate and is surrounded by a blue 3×3 square centered on that point (top-left and bottom-right corners listed above). Squares are represented explicitly; where squares would touch or align in other cases their borders would merge, but in this test case all five 3×3 squares are separate as given.
