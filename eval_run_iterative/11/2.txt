ITERATION 1 of 2: Extracted Transformation Rules

Observations / rules:
- Grid size unchanged: 6x6.
- The input red horizontal line at row 3 is extended leftwards to start at column 2. That single operation produces:
  - horizontal_line(output,start(3,2),end(3,5),color(red),length(4))
  - Additionally two single-cell points are created to the left of that extended line: a red point at (3,0) and a yellow point at (3,1).
  - In short: original red segment is expanded left to col 2; cols 0 and 1 become isolated points (col0 red, col1 yellow).
- The input cyan vertical line at column 1 is extended downward and split by the horizontal row:
  - It is lengthened upward segment to include row 2: vertical_line(output,start(0,1),end(2,1),color(cyan),length(3))
  - A second cyan segment is created below the horizontal row (rows 4–5): vertical_line(output,start(4,1),end(5,1),color(cyan),length(2))
  - Thus the vertical cyan line is continued above the horizontal row and reappears below it, leaving the cell at (3,1) occupied by the yellow point.

Output primitives (as present):
- grid_size(output,6,6)
- horizontal_line(output,start(3,2),end(3,5),color(red),length(4))
- point(output,(3,0),red)
- point(output,(3,1),yellow)
- vertical_line(output,start(0,1),end(2,1),color(cyan),length(3))
- vertical_line(output,start(4,1),end(5,1),color(cyan),length(2))
ITERATION 2 of 2: Extracted Transformation Rules

Conclusion: the new pair supports and refines the previous rule. Consolidated rule and expected output primitives:

Rules
- Grid size unchanged.
- Red horizontal line on some row is extended toward the cyan vertical by two cells so that the red line becomes adjacent to the cyan column (i.e., the red line ends at column cyan_col - 1 if the cyan is to its right, or starts at column cyan_col + 1 if the cyan is to its left).
- The cell at (row_of_horizontal, cyan_col) becomes a yellow point (replacing cyan at that row).
- The cell immediately on the far side of the cyan (same row, column = cyan_col ± 1 away from the horizontal) becomes a single red point.
- The cyan vertical is split into two vertical segments that avoid the horizontal row:
  - Top segment: from row 0 down to row_of_horizontal - 1 (if row_of_horizontal > 0).
  - Bottom segment: from row_of_horizontal + 1 down to last row (if row_of_horizontal < height-1).

Expected output primitives (given input primitives: horizontal_line(input,start(R,C1),end(R,C2),red) and vertical_line(input,start(0,CC),end(K,CC),cyan)):
- grid_size(output, same as input)
- horizontal_line(output,start(R, new_start),end(R, new_end),color(red),length(new_len))
  where new_start/new_end are chosen so the red line is extended by two cells toward column CC and becomes adjacent to CC.
- point(output,(R,CC),yellow)
- point(output,(R,CC + sign),red) where sign = +1 if cyan is to the right of the original red segment, sign = -1 if cyan is to the left.
- vertical_line(output,start(0,CC),end(R-1,CC),color(cyan),length=R) if R>0
- vertical_line(output,start(R+1,CC),end(height-1,CC),color(cyan),length=height-R-1) if R<height-1

This matches both prior examples: the red horizontal is extended toward the cyan to become adjacent, a yellow point is placed at the cyan column on that row, a red point is placed immediately beyond the cyan, and the cyan vertical is split into top and bottom segments leaving out the horizontal's row.
FINAL RULE EXPLANATION:

Conclusion: the new pair supports and refines the previous rule. Consolidated rule and expected output primitives:

Rules
- Grid size unchanged.
- Red horizontal line on some row is extended toward the cyan vertical by two cells so that the red line becomes adjacent to the cyan column (i.e., the red line ends at column cyan_col - 1 if the cyan is to its right, or starts at column cyan_col + 1 if the cyan is to its left).
- The cell at (row_of_horizontal, cyan_col) becomes a yellow point (replacing cyan at that row).
- The cell immediately on the far side of the cyan (same row, column = cyan_col ± 1 away from the horizontal) becomes a single red point.
- The cyan vertical is split into two vertical segments that avoid the horizontal row:
  - Top segment: from row 0 down to row_of_horizontal - 1 (if row_of_horizontal > 0).
  - Bottom segment: from row_of_horizontal + 1 down to last row (if row_of_horizontal < height-1).

Expected output primitives (given input primitives: horizontal_line(input,start(R,C1),end(R,C2),red) and vertical_line(input,start(0,CC),end(K,CC),cyan)):
- grid_size(output, same as input)
- horizontal_line(output,start(R, new_start),end(R, new_end),color(red),length(new_len))
  where new_start/new_end are chosen so the red line is extended by two cells toward column CC and becomes adjacent to CC.
- point(output,(R,CC),yellow)
- point(output,(R,CC + sign),red) where sign = +1 if cyan is to the right of the original red segment, sign = -1 if cyan is to the left.
- vertical_line(output,start(0,CC),end(R-1,CC),color(cyan),length=R) if R>0
- vertical_line(output,start(R+1,CC),end(height-1,CC),color(cyan),length=height-R-1) if R<height-1

This matches both prior examples: the red horizontal is extended toward the cyan to become adjacent, a yellow point is placed at the cyan column on that row, a red point is placed immediately beyond the cyan, and the cyan vertical is split into top and bottom segments leaving out the horizontal's row.
STEP 3: Retrieved Test Input Primitives

Input grid:
 grid_size(input,6,6) horizontal_line(input,start(4,0),end(4,1),color(red),length(2)) vertical_line(input,start(0,3),end(1,3),color(cyan),length(2))

Output grid:

STEP 4: Predicted Test Output

grid_size(output,6,6)

Primitives:
- horizontal_line(output,start(4,0),end(4,2),color(red),length(3))
- point(output,(4,3),color(yellow))
- point(output,(4,4),color(red))
- vertical_line(output,start(0,3),end(3,3),color(cyan),length(4))
- vertical_line(output,start(5,3),end(5,3),color(cyan),length(1))

Natural-language description:
The 6x6 grid is unchanged in size. The red horizontal on row 4 (originally columns 0–1) is extended right so it now runs from (4,0) to (4,2), becoming adjacent to the cyan column at column 3. The cell at (4,3) (the cyan column on that row) is made a yellow point. Immediately to the right of that yellow cell, at (4,4), is a single red point. The cyan vertical column at column 3 is split so it avoids row 4: a top cyan segment runs from (0,3) down to (3,3), and a bottom cyan segment is at (5,3).
