ITERATION 1 of 2: Extracted Transformation Rules

Observations / rules
- Global symmetry: each line is reflected across the grid centerline perpendicular to its orientation.
  - Vertical (cyan) segments are mirrored across the horizontal midline (row 2.5).  
  - Horizontal (red) segments are mirrored across the vertical midline (col 2.5).
- Inward extension: after mirroring, each original and its mirror extend one cell toward the center (i.e., vertical segments extend toward the middle row; horizontal segments extend toward the middle column).
- Conflict resolution (overlap of red and cyan): any cell where a horizontal red and a vertical cyan would occupy the same cell becomes a yellow point instead; the cyan does not occupy that cell (cyan is split into separate segments around it).
- Resulting horizontal red pieces from original + mirror + inward extensions may join into a longer horizontal segment except where blocked by a cyan→yellow conflict.

Predicted output primitives (derived from the input primitives by the rules above)
- horizontal_line(output,start(3,2),end(3,5),color(red),length(4))
- point(output,(3,0),red)        (mirror cell from the red segment)
- point(output,(3,1),yellow)     (overlap of mirrored/extended red with cyan → yellow)
- vertical_line(output,start(0,1),end(2,1),color(cyan),length(3))  (top cyan segment extended inward)
- vertical_line(output,start(4,1),end(5,1),color(cyan),length(2))  (mirror of original cyan at bottom)
ITERATION 2 of 2: Extracted Transformation Rules

Conclusion: the new pair supports the prior pattern but requires a small clarification about conditional extension when conflicts occur.

Refined rules
- Mirror each line across the grid centerline perpendicular to its orientation:
  - horizontal lines: reflect across the vertical center (c' = W-1-c).
  - vertical lines: reflect across the horizontal center (r' = H-1-r).
- Inward extension: both the original and the mirrored line attempt to extend one cell toward the grid center (horizontal lines extend one cell toward the vertical center; vertical lines extend one cell toward the horizontal center).
- Conflict resolution (red horizontal vs cyan vertical):
  - Any cell that would be occupied by both colors becomes a yellow point.
  - Neither the red horizontal nor the cyan vertical occupies that yellow cell; each line is split/trimmed around it.
  - Because of this, a line's inward extension can be prevented if the inward cell is a conflict; the opposite (mirror) side can still extend if its inward cell is not conflicted.
- After applying mirroring, conditional inward extensions, and removing conflicted cells, contiguous same-color filled cells are represented as maximal horizontal/vertical lines; isolated single filled cells become point primitives.

Predicted output primitives for the new input (grid_0) under these rules
- grid_size(output,6,6)
- horizontal_line(output,start(2,0),end(2,3),color(red),length(4))
- point(output,(2,4),yellow)
- point(output,(2,5),red)
- vertical_line(output,start(0,4),end(1,4),color(cyan),length(2))
- vertical_line(output,start(3,4),end(5,4),color(cyan),length(3))

These match the observed output; therefore the new pair supports the refined rule set.

STEP 4: Predicted Test Output

Output primitives
- grid_size(output,6,6)
- horizontal_line(output,start(4,0),end(4,2),color(red),length(3))
- horizontal_line(output,start(4,4),end(4,5),color(red),length(2))
- vertical_line(output,start(0,3),end(3,3),color(cyan),length(4))
- point(output,(5,3),cyan)
- point(output,(4,3),yellow)

Natural-language description
- The input red horizontal segment at row 4, cols 0–1 is mirrored to cols 4–5 on the same row. Both the original and mirrored red segments attempt a one-cell inward extension toward the vertical center: the left segment extends to (4,2) (allowed) and the right segment would extend to (4,3) but that cell conflicts with cyan.
- The input cyan vertical at col 3, rows 0–1 is mirrored to rows 4–5 in the same column. Both the original and mirrored cyan segments attempt a one-cell inward extension toward the horizontal center: the top extends to (2,3) and the bottom extends to (3,3). These extensions connect with the top segment so the cyan forms a contiguous vertical run from (0,3) down to (3,3); the mirrored bottom also leaves a single cyan cell at (5,3).
- The cell (4,3) would be occupied by both red (right inward extension) and cyan (mirrored original), so by rule it becomes a yellow point; neither red nor cyan occupies that cell and the lines are split/trimmed around it.
- After trimming and merging contiguous same-color cells, the red cells form two horizontal lines (cols 0–2 and cols 4–5 on row 4), cyan forms a vertical line from (0,3) to (3,3) plus an isolated cyan point at (5,3), and the overlapping cell is a yellow point at (4,3).
