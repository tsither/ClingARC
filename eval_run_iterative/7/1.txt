ITERATION 1 of 2: Extracted Transformation Rules

Observations / rule (concise):

Given two isolated points A(r1,c1,color1) and B(r2,c2,color2) in an MxN grid (here 9x9, rows/cols 0..8):

1. Two same‑color crosses are created centered on each input point.
   - Cross at A(color1):
     - Vertical arm at column c1 from row (r1-1) to row (r2-1).
     - Horizontal arm at row r1 from column 0 to column (c2-1).
   - Cross at B(color2):
     - Vertical arm at column c2 from row (r1+1) to row (r2+1).
     - Horizontal arm at row r2 from column (c1+1) to the right edge (max column).

2. Two red single points are placed at the swapped coordinates:
   - Red point at (r1, c2).
   - Red point at (r2, c1).

3. Two single points (colors of the original centers) are placed one row beyond the vertical span at the swapped columns:
   - Point color2 at (r1-1, c2).
   - Point color1 at (r2+1, c1).

4. On each center's row, any remaining cells on the far side of the red point are filled by a short horizontal segment in the center's color:
   - On row r1 (A's row): fill columns (c2+1 .. max_col) with color1 (if any).
   - On row r2 (B's row): fill columns (0 .. c1-1) with color2 (if any).

Applied to the given input A=(1,3,cyan), B=(7,6,orange) (grid 9x9), the output primitives are exactly:

- cross(center(1,3), vertical(top(0,3),bottom(6,3)), horizontal(left(1,0),right(1,5)), color(cyan))
- cross(center(7,6), vertical(top(2,6),bottom(8,6)), horizontal(left(7,4),right(7,8)), color(orange))
- horizontal_line(row 1, cols 7–8, color cyan)
- horizontal_line(row 7, cols 0–2, color orange)
- point(1,6) color red
- point(7,3) color red
- point(0,6) color orange
- point(8,3) color cyan
- grid_size 9x9

These match the output.
ITERATION 2 of 2: Extracted Transformation Rules

Conclusion: the new input-output pair supports the previous pattern but refines several bounds/details. Revised concise rule and the primitives you should expect in the output:

Setup: two isolated input points A(r1,c1,color1) and B(r2,c2,color2) in an MxN grid, with r1 < r2 (if not, swap labels so A is the upper point).

1) Two same‑color crosses centered on the input points:
   - Cross at A(color1):
     - Vertical arm at column c1 spanning rows 0 .. (r2 - 1) (inclusive).
     - Horizontal arm at row r1 spanning columns 0 .. (c2 - 1) (inclusive).
   - Cross at B(color2):
     - Vertical arm at column c2 spanning rows (r1 + 1) .. (max_row) (inclusive).
     - Horizontal arm at row r2 spanning columns (c1 + 1) .. (max_col) (inclusive).

2) Swapped red centers:
   - Place red at S1 = (r1, c2) and S2 = (r2, c1).

3) Far‑side horizontal fill on each center row:
   - On A's row r1: fill columns (c2 + 1) .. max_col with color1 (if any).
   - On B's row r2: fill columns 0 .. (c1 - 1) with color2 (if any).

4) Vertical filler segments at the swapped columns outside the crosses:
   - In column c2 place color2 from row 0 .. (r1 - 1) (if r1 > 0). If this reduces to one cell, it appears as a point; if >1, as a vertical_line.
   - In column c1 place color1 from row (r2 + 1) .. max_row (if r2 < max_row). Again single cell becomes a point, >1 becomes a vertical_line.

5) Intersections where red centers sit:
   - The swapped locations S1 and S2 are red, but they lie at the crossing of the color1 horizontal and color2 vertical (or vice versa). In outputs this can be represented as an intersection primitive: center = S1 (red), vertical = color2 (length = total number of color2 cells in that column), horizontal = color1 (length = total number of color1 cells in that row). Same for S2.

6) Grid size is preserved.

How this amends the previous statement:
- Previously stated top of A's vertical was r1 - 1; corrected to 0 (A's vertical always extends up to grid top).
- Single color points at (r1-1,c2) and (r2+1,c1) are generalized to vertical segments 0..(r1-1) in column c2 and (r2+1)..max in column c1 (which collapse to points when length=1).
- The red swapped cells are centers of intersections where the two colored lines pass through (but the center pixel is red).

The new pair (grid_0) matches these refined rules (it shows vertical segments of length 2 instead of single points and the intersections are explicitly represented), so it supports and clarifies the earlier prediction.

Natural-language description:
- The 9x9 grid is preserved.
- From input A = (1,4,cyan): a cyan vertical arm runs in column 4 from row 0 down to row 5, plus a cyan vertical filler from row 7 to 8 at column 4. On row 1 there is a small cyan point at column 0 and a long cyan horizontal run from column 2 through 8 (column 1 is the red swapped cell).
- From input B = (6,1,orange): an orange vertical arm runs in column 1 from row 2 down to row 8, plus an orange point at (0,1). On row 6 there are orange horizontals from columns 0..3 and 5..8 (column 4 is the red swapped cell).
- The swapped centers S1 = (1,1) and S2 = (6,4) are red points that sit at the intersections between the cyan and orange segments as prescribed.
