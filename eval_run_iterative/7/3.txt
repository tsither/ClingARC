ITERATION 1 of 2: Extracted Transformation Rules

Observations / rule (concise)
- Given two isolated points A=(r1,c1,color1) and B=(r2,c2,color2):
  - For each point produce a same-colored cross centered at that point.
    - Each cross's arm that points toward the other center extends up to one cell before the other center (i.e., stops at r = r_other ±1 or c = c_other ±1).
    - The arm away from the other center extends to the grid edge.
  - On each center's row, also draw a same-colored horizontal segment on the far side of the other center:
    - If the other center is to the right, draw from (other_col+1) to grid_right; if to the left, draw from grid_left to (other_col-1).
  - Put red single cells at the two "crossing" coordinates combining row of one with column of the other: (r1,c2) and (r2,c1).
  - Put a single-colored cell of each center's color at the grid edge in that center's column on the side opposite the other center:
    - If the other center is below, put the color at bottom row of that column; if the other center is above, put it at top row.

Primitives produced for this input
- cross(output, center(1,3), vertical(top(0,3), bottom(6,3)), horizontal(left(1,0), right(1,5)), color(cyan))
- cross(output, center(7,6), vertical(top(2,6), bottom(8,6)), horizontal(left(7,4), right(7,8)), color(orange))
- horizontal_line(output, start(1,7), end(1,8), color(cyan), length(2))  (cyan segment beyond other center to right)
- horizontal_line(output, start(7,0), end(7,2), color(orange), length(3)) (orange segment beyond other center to left)
- point(output, (1,6), red)
- point(output, (7,3), red)
- point(output, (0,6), orange) (orange at top of its column, opposite side from other center)
- point(output, (8,3), cyan)   (cyan at bottom of its column, opposite side from other center)
- grid_size(output,9,9)
ITERATION 2 of 2: Extracted Transformation Rules

Verdict
- The new pair supports the core rule set from before (crosses at each isolated point, horizontal extensions beyond the other center, red cells at the two mixed coordinates). It adds a small variant in how the “edge” fill in each center’s column is represented (sometimes a single point, sometimes a short vertical segment). Update the rules to account for that variability.

Refined rules (concise)
- For two isolated points A=(r1,c1,color1) and B=(r2,c2,color2):
  1. Produce a same-colored cross centered at A:
     - Vertical arm runs from the grid edge on the side away from B to one cell before B's row on the side toward B. (i.e., top = 0 or bottom = grid_end; toward B stops at r = r2 ± 1).
     - Horizontal arm runs from the grid edge on the side away from B to one cell before B's column on the side toward B.
  2. Produce the symmetric same-colored cross centered at B (same extension rules, mirrored).
  3. On each center's row, add a same-colored horizontal segment continuing past the other center out to the grid edge (i.e., start just beyond the other center's column and extend to that edge).
  4. At the two mixed coordinates (r1,c2) and (r2,c1):
     - Place red single cells. These locations also correspond to intersections where the horizontal arm of one cross crosses the vertical arm of the other; they may be reported either as explicit red points or as intersection primitives (vertical of one color crossing horizontal of the other).
  5. In each center's column on the side opposite the other center, fill from the grid edge inward up to the first occupied cell (this may be a single cell or a short vertical segment depending on distances/overlap). In some outputs this is represented as a single point, in others as a short vertical_line primitive.

Primitives expected in an output (symbolic form)
- cross(output, center(r1,c1), vertical(top(0,c1), bottom(r2-1,c1)), horizontal(left(r1,0), right(r1,c2-1)), color(color1))
- cross(output, center(r2,c2), vertical(top(r1+1,c2), bottom(grid_end,c2)), horizontal(left(r2,c1+1), right(r2,grid_end)), color(color2))
- horizontal_line(output, start(r1,min(c2+1,grid_right)), end(r1,grid_right), color=color1)  (extension past other center)
- horizontal_line(output, start(r2,grid_left), end(r2,max(c1-1,grid_left)), color=color2)  (extension past other center)
- point(output,(r1,c2),red) and point(output,(r2,c1),red)  (or equivalent intersection primitives)
- vertical fill in column c1 on the far side from B: vertical_line(output,start=grid_edge,row_inward,end=just_before_first_occupied,c1,color1) — length may be 1 or >1
- vertical fill in column c2 on the far side from A: vertical_line(output,start=grid_edge,row_inward,end=just_before_first_occupied,c2,color2) — length may be 1 or >1
- grid_size(output, same_as_input)

Notes
- The new pair does not contradict earlier rules; it only shows that the "edge fill" can be multiple cells (vertical_line) rather than always a single cell (point). Also intersections may be described as intersection primitives in some outputs.

STEP 4: Predicted Test Output

Answer — output primitives and short description

Primitives (output):
- grid_size(output,9,9).
- cross(output, center(1,4), vertical(top(0,4), bottom(5,4)), horizontal(left(1,2), right(1,8)), color(cyan)).
- cross(output, center(6,1), vertical(top(2,1), bottom(8,1)), horizontal(left(6,0), right(6,3)), color(orange)).
- vertical_line(output, start(0,4), end(5,4), color(cyan)).  % top-side fill in column 4 (same as cyan cross vertical)
- vertical_line(output, start(2,1), end(8,1), color(orange)). % bottom-side fill in column 1 (same as orange cross vertical)
- horizontal_line(output, start(1,2), end(1,8), color(cyan)).  % cyan row extension past other center
- horizontal_line(output, start(6,0), end(6,3), color(orange)). % orange row extension past other center
- point(output,(1,1),red).
- point(output,(6,4),red).

Natural-language description:
- Two same-colored crosses are drawn centered on the input isolated points: a cyan cross centered at (1,4) and an orange cross centered at (6,1).
- Each cross's vertical arm runs from the grid edge on the side away from the other center to one cell before the other center's row (cyan vertical: rows 0–5 in column 4; orange vertical: rows 2–8 in column 1). Each cross's horizontal arm runs from the opposite grid edge to one cell before the other center's column (cyan horizontal: row 1, cols 2–8; orange horizontal: row 6, cols 0–3).
- The two mixed coordinates (1,1) and (6,4), where the arms intersect, are single red cells.
- The output grid size is unchanged (9x9).
