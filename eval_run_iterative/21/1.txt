ITERATION 1 of 4: Extracted Transformation Rules

Observations / rules
- Crop to the 4×4 top-left block of the input (rows 0–3, cols 0–3). red crosses and the yellow full row outside that block are ignored.
- Recolor all blue primitives inside that 4×4 block to green.
- Complete fragmented blue strokes inside the 4×4 block into continuous orthogonal and diagonal strokes: fill the central vertical axis (column 1) fully, fill a short vertical on column 2 (rows 1–2), extend the partial diagonals into length-3 diagonals across the block, and add short horizontal segments to connect these lines. (In short: blue pattern in the 4×4 is promoted to a symmetric connected green motif.)

Predicted output primitives (in the 4×4 cropped grid)
- grid_size(output,4,4)
- Diagonals (green):
  - start(0,0) – end(2,2), length 3
  - start(0,1) – end(2,3), length 3
  - start(3,0) – end(1,2), length 3
  - start(3,1) – end(2,2), length 2
- Horizontals (green):
  - start(0,0) – end(0,1), length 2
  - start(1,1) – end(1,2), length 2
  - start(2,1) – end(2,3), length 3
  - start(3,0) – end(3,1), length 2
- Verticals (green):
  - start(0,1) – end(3,1), length 4 (full column 1)
  - start(1,2) – end(2,2), length 2

These output primitives match the connected, recolored completion of the input’s blue pattern inside the top-left 4×4 block.
ITERATION 2 of 4: Extracted Transformation Rules

Conclusion: the new (grid_2) pair supports the previous hypothesis (crop + recolor + local completion) but requires a small refinement.

Refined rule summary
- Crop: take the top-left 4×4 block of the input and re-index it as the output grid (grid_size(output,4,4)). Primitives outside that 4×4 are ignored (red/yellow in these examples).
- Recolor: every blue primitive inside that 4×4 becomes green in the output.
- Local completion/merging: within the 4×4, existing blue segments are merged and extended only as needed to form coherent connected strokes:
  - Diagonal fragments on the same slope are merged/extended into longer diagonals (often length 3 when possible within the 4×4).
  - Short horizontal and vertical segments are added or length-adjusted to connect those diagonals into a compact motif (but the central vertical column is not always fully filled — it is extended only insofar as needed to connect existing blue endpoints).
  - Terminal blue cells that cannot be merged into longer strokes can become isolated green points.
- No new colored primitives are created outside the cropped area; red/yellow primitives are ignored.

Primitives observed in this new output (consistent with the refined rule)
- grid_size(output,4,4)
- Diagonals (green): start(0,1)-end(2,3) length 3; start(1,0)-end(0,1) length 2; start(1,1)-end(2,2) length 2; start(3,2)-end(2,3) length 2
- Horizontals (green): start(1,0)-end(1,2) length 3; start(2,2)-end(2,3) length 2
- Verticals (green): start(0,1)-end(1,1) length 2; start(1,2)-end(3,2) length 3
- isolated_point(output,(3,0),green)

Support vs. contradiction
- Supports: cropping to 4×4 and recoloring blue→green; forming connected motifs by merging/lengthening diagonals and adding short orthogonal connectors.
- Refinement needed: completion is conservative and context-driven (connect existing endpoints) rather than always filling a full central axis or producing the exact symmetric motif seen in the other example; isolated terminal points can remain.
ITERATION 3 of 4: Extracted Transformation Rules

Verdict
- Supported: The new pair supports the core hypotheses: crop to the top-left 4×4 and recolor blue→green.
- Refined/contradicted: It refines the "local completion" part — completion is not always additive (merging/adding strokes). When the 4×4 contains many overlapping blue primitives the transformation can be reductive: it simplifies/prunes the pattern to a small canonical motif rather than preserving/connecting every stroke.

Refined rule summary
- Crop: output = top-left 4×4 block of the input (grid_size(output,4,4)). Ignore primitives outside that block (red/yellow).
- Recolor: every blue primitive inside that 4×4 becomes green in the output.
- Simplify vs. complete (context-driven):
  - If blue structure is sparse, the algorithm tends to merge/extend fragments into connected strokes (as in previous examples).
  - If blue structure is dense/overlapping in the 4×4, the algorithm simplifies: it prunes many intermediate segments and leaves a compact canonical motif (in this instance: top-right short horizontal, bottom-right short diagonal, and isolated corner points). The simplification preserves a few representative primitives (often on edges/corners and on the right/bottom area) rather than retaining every original fragment.
- No new colored primitives are generated outside the cropped area; red/yellow are ignored.

Expected primitives for this input (as observed)
- grid_size(output,4,4)
- diagonal_line(output,start(2,2),end(3,3),color(green),length(2))
- horizontal_line(output,start(0,2),end(0,3),color(green),length(2))
- isolated_point(output,(0,0),green)
- isolated_point(output,(3,0),green)
ITERATION 4 of 4: Extracted Transformation Rules

Short verdict
- Supported. This new pair follows the same core rules: crop to the top-left 4×4 and recolor blue→green. It also fits the prior refinement that dense/overlapping blue structure inside the 4×4 is simplified/converted into a small canonical motif in the lower-right of the 4×4.

Refined/confirmed rule summary
- Crop: output is the input's top-left 4×4 (grid_size(output,4,4)). Ignore red/yellow primitives outside that block.
- Recolor: every blue primitive inside that 4×4 becomes green.
- Compactification pattern (when multiple/overlapping blue primitives occur near the lower-right of the 4×4):
  - The transformation builds a compact connected motif around cells (2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(3,3).
  - It produces diagonals that converge on that region, verticals and horizontals that complete a small square/connected block, and often extends a horizontal across the entire bottom row (row 3).
  - Sparse blue elements away from that region (isolated points or small strokes in other quadrants) are typically dropped.

Expected primitives in the output (based on this input)
- grid_size(output,4,4)
- diagonal_line(output,start(2,2),end(3,3),color(green),length(2))
- diagonal_line(output,start(3,1),end(2,2),color(green),length(2))
- diagonal_line(output,start(3,2),end(2,3),color(green),length(2))
- horizontal_line(output,start(2,2),end(2,3),color(green),length(2))
- horizontal_line(output,start(3,0),end(3,3),color(green),length(4))
- vertical_line(output,start(2,2),end(3,2),color(green),length(2))
- vertical_line(output,start(2,3),end(3,3),color(green),length(2))

No contradiction to previous hypothesis; this example reinforces the “prune-to-canonical-motif-in-bottom-right” behavior when the 4×4 contains overlapping blue strokes.

STEP 4: Predicted Test Output

Explanation
- Apply the predicted rules: crop to the top-left 4×4, recolor all blue primitives inside that block to green, and convert the overlapping blue cross+point into the canonical compact motif in the lower-right 2×2 region (cells (2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(3,3)). Sparse blue at (3,0) is dropped.
