ITERATION 1 of 4: Extracted Transformation Rules

Summary rule
- Crop the input to the top 4 rows (rows 0–3, all 4 columns). Convert every blue primitive in that 4×4 window into green primitives. While converting, extend diagonal and straight segments by one cell and mirror/propagate them so they form continuous crossing diagonals and connecting horizontal/vertical strokes across the 4×4 output.

How input primitives map to output primitives (concise)
- Blue short "\" diagonals in the 4×4 become longer "\" diagonals of length 3 in green and also produce a shifted copy so the two overlapping "\" diagonals span columns 0–2 and 1–3:
  - input diagonal (0,2)-(1,3) → output diagonals (0,0)-(2,2) and (0,1)-(2,3).
  - input diagonal (2,1)-(3,2) → output diagonals (3,0)-(1,2) and (3,1)-(2,2) (the second is length 2).
- Blue horizontal length-2 segments in rows 0–3 are converted to green horizontals at the same rows, extended/connected to form longer runs where appropriate:
  - input horizontals → output horizontals: (0,0)-(0,1), (1,1)-(1,2), (2,1)-(2,3), (3,0)-(3,1).
- The short blue vertical (rows 0–1) is converted and extended into a full green vertical through the central column of the 4×4:
  - input vertical (0,3)-(1,3) → output vertical (0,1)-(3,1) (length 4).
  - a smaller vertical segment appears at column 2 in rows 1–2: output vertical (1,2)-(2,2).

Output primitives produced (as in result)
- grid_size(output,4,4)
- diagonal_line(output,start(0,0),end(2,2),color(green),length(3))
- diagonal_line(output,start(0,1),end(2,3),color(green),length(3))
- diagonal_line(output,start(3,0),end(1,2),color(green),length(3))
- diagonal_line(output,start(3,1),end(2,2),color(green),length(2))
- horizontal_line(output,start(0,0),end(0,1),color(green),length(2))
- horizontal_line(output,start(1,1),end(1,2),color(green),length(2))
- horizontal_line(output,start(2,1),end(2,3),color(green),length(3))
- horizontal_line(output,start(3,0),end(3,1),color(green),length(2))
- vertical_line(output,start(0,1),end(3,1),color(green),length(4))
- vertical_line(output,start(1,2),end(2,2),color(green),length(2))

(Implicit rule: ignore red crosses and the yellow full row outside the top 4 rows; only blue primitives inside the top 4×4 are converted and propagated into the 4×4 green pattern.)
ITERATION 2 of 4: Extracted Transformation Rules

Verdict
- The new pair supports the original summary: we crop to the top 4 rows (4×4 window) and convert only the blue primitives in that window into green primitives. Red/yellow primitives outside or below that window are ignored.
- Refinement: the conversion preserves diagonal orientation, tries to extend diagonals to the maximal continuous run inside the 4×4 (typically length 3 when possible), and propagates/merges overlaps so diagonals and straight strokes form continuous crossing diagonals and connecting horizontals/verticals. Vertical/horizontal outputs are placed mostly in the central columns (col 1 and col 2) and may be extended/truncated depending on overlaps with converted diagonals.

Concise mappings observed in this new pair
- Blue diagonals → green diagonals (orientation preserved; extended where possible)
  - input diagonal (0,1)-(1,2) (blue) → output diagonal (0,1)-(2,3) (green, length 3) (extended downward-right).
  - input diagonal (1,0)-(0,1) (blue) → output diagonal (1,0)-(0,1) (green, length 2) (preserved because it lies at boundary).
  - overlapping/longer blue diagonals within rows 1–3 → produce shorter shifted/merged green diagonals in the 4×4 (e.g., input (1,0)-(3,2), (3,0)-(1,2), (3,1)-(1,3) map to output diagonals (1,1)-(2,2) and (3,2)-(2,3) etc.).
- Blue verticals → green verticals or points depending on overlap
  - input vertical (1,2)-(3,2) (blue) → output vertical (1,2)-(3,2) (green) (preserved).
  - input vertical (1,0)-(3,0) (blue) does not become a full vertical here; bottom cell becomes an isolated green point (3,0) because other converted strokes occupy the upper positions in that column.
  - small blue verticals near top (from diagonal endpoints) can become short green verticals in central columns, e.g., a blue structure produced vertical (0,1)-(1,1) in output.
- Blue horizontals → green horizontals, extended/connected where diagonals/verticals provide anchors
  - input short horizontals in rows 1–3 become green horizontals that often span between newly created verticals: e.g., input pieces produce output (1,0)-(1,2) and (2,2)-(2,3).

Rules to apply for future pairs (succinct)
1. Crop input to rows 0–3 (all 4 columns). Ignore non-blue primitives.
2. Convert each blue primitive to green:
   - Keep diagonal orientation. Extend diagonals as far as possible inside the 4×4 (prefer length 3 when room exists). Overlapping blue diagonals produce multiple merged/shifted green diagonals to form continuous crossing patterns.
   - Convert blue verticals to green verticals if they remain unblocked; if upper cells are occupied by extended diagonals/horizontals, verticals may be truncated to shorter verticals or isolated points.
   - Convert blue horizontals to green horizontals and extend them to connect between vertical strokes created by the converted diagonals/verticals.
3. Favor placing continuous straight strokes in the central columns (col 1 and col 2) when overlaps/merging occur.

Conclusion
- The new pair refines the earlier rule: extension and merging of diagonals is deterministic (extend to fill available 4×4 space), and the resulting diagonals/horizontals/verticals interact so that some input verticals can be truncated to points when overwritten by these extensions. Overall behavior remains consistent with the previous prediction.
ITERATION 3 of 4: Extracted Transformation Rules

Verdict
- The new pair mostly supports the earlier summary: we crop to the top 4 rows (4×4 window) and only blue primitives are converted into green primitives. However, this case refines the spatial packing/translation behavior: converted blue strokes are translated rightward in the 4×4, some diagonals are shortened to small corner segments, and verticals in column 0 are frequently truncated to isolated green points (top/bottom).

Concrete correspondences in this pair
- Blue -> Green and cropping: only blue primitives in rows 0–3 are considered; red/yellow are ignored.
- Translation/packing: many converted strokes are shifted right by two columns within the 4×4 (so content that was in columns 0–1 is moved to columns 2–3).
  - Example: blue horizontal at (0,0)-(0,1) becomes green horizontal at (0,2)-(0,3) (shift +2 columns).
- Diagonal shortening and corner placement:
  - Longer blue diagonals in the input are shortened/moved to occupy bottom-right corner(s) in the 4×4: here a small green diagonal appears at (2,2)-(3,3).
- Vertical truncation → isolated points:
  - The blue vertical (0,0)-(2,0) does not survive as a full vertical; its top and bottom endpoints appear as isolated green points at (0,0) and (3,0) (middle cell(s) get overwritten/truncated).
- Not every blue primitive preserves full length/original coordinates — overlaps and the packing translation determine final placement and possible truncation.

Refined rule summary to apply going forward
1. Crop input to rows 0–3 (4×4 window). Ignore non-blue primitives.
2. Convert each blue primitive to green.
   - Apply a horizontal translation (observed +2 columns) when packing shapes into the 4×4; small variations allowed to resolve overlaps.
   - Preserve diagonal orientation but shorten/clip them to fit available space; tend to place shortened diagonals in the bottom-right quadrant when overlaps occur.
   - Convert horizontals into horizontals, but they may be shifted to the right and extended/truncated to connect with other converted strokes.
   - Vertical strokes can become shorter verticals or be reduced to isolated points at endpoints if their middle cells are overwritten by other converted strokes.
3. Resolve overlaps by favoring continuous crossings and by truncating verticals in column 0 into points when necessary.

Predicted primitives for this specific input (as observed)
- diagonal_line(output,start(2,2),end(3,3),color(green),length(2))
- horizontal_line(output,start(0,2),end(0,3),color(green),length(2))
- isolated_point(output,(0,0),green)
- isolated_point(output,(3,0),green)

Conclusion
- The new pair supports the main rule (crop + blue→green) but adds a consistent packing/translation behavior (rightward shift, bottom-right placement of shortened diagonals, truncation of column-0 verticals to points).
ITERATION 4 of 4: Extracted Transformation Rules

Short verdict
- Supported: crop to top 4 rows; only blue → green; diagonals are preserved in orientation and become small corner diagonals in the 4×4; top verticals move into the bottom area as short verticals.
- Refined / changed: the earlier "uniform +2 column shift" is too rigid. Packing is adaptive: converted blue strokes are compacted into the lower rows (rows 2–3) and the right-hand columns (cols 2–3) when possible, but strokes already in cols 2–3 often keep their column indices. Isolated points in left columns can be absorbed into a filled bottom row rather than always becoming isolated points.

Refined rule summary
1. Crop input to rows 0–3 (4×4 window). Ignore non-blue primitives.
2. Convert every blue primitive to green.
3. Pack converted green primitives into a dense configuration in the 4×4:
   - Prefer placing/assembling strokes in the lower two rows (rows 2–3) and right columns (cols 2–3).
   - Diagonals keep their orientation but may be shortened/clipped to 2-cell diagonals in the bottom-right region.
   - Verticals in top rows are translated down to rows 2–3 in the same column and usually remain length 2 (unless overwritten).
   - Isolated points in left columns may become part of a continuous horizontal at row 3 (bottom row) if packing/overlap calls for filling that row.
   - Overlaps are resolved by forming continuous connections (full bottom row or 2×2 block in cols 2–3) rather than preserving every original coordinate.

Predicted primitives for this input (what appears in the output)
- grid_size(output,4,4)
- diagonal_line(output,start(2,2),end(3,3),color(green),length(2))
- diagonal_line(output,start(3,1),end(2,2),color(green),length(2))
- diagonal_line(output,start(3,2),end(2,3),color(green),length(2))
- horizontal_line(output,start(2,2),end(2,3),color(green),length(2))
- horizontal_line(output,start(3,0),end(3,3),color(green),length(4))
- vertical_line(output,start(2,2),end(3,2),color(green),length(2))
- vertical_line(output,start(2,3),end(3,3),color(green),length(2))

Conclusion
- The new pair confirms crop + blue→green and the tendency to compress converted strokes into a dense lower-right arrangement, but shows the packing translation is context-dependent (not a fixed +2 columns).

STEP 4: Predicted Test Output

Answer — predicted output primitives and short explanation

Primitives (ASP-style):
- grid_size(output,4,4)
- diagonal_line(output,start(2,2),end(3,3),color(green),length(2))
- diagonal_line(output,start(3,1),end(2,2),color(green),length(2))
- diagonal_line(output,start(3,2),end(2,3),color(green),length(2))
- horizontal_line(output,start(2,2),end(2,3),color(green),length(2))
- horizontal_line(output,start(3,0),end(3,3),color(green),length(4))
- vertical_line(output,start(2,2),end(3,2),color(green),length(2))
- vertical_line(output,start(2,3),end(3,3),color(green),length(2))

Natural-language description / justification
- The input is cropped to the top 4 rows (4×4 output).
- Only blue primitives in the input are kept and recolored green (the blue cross centered near row 1, col 2 and the isolated blue point at (3,0)).
- Those converted primitives are packed into a dense lower region of the 4×4: diagonals preserve orientation but are shortened to 2-cell corner diagonals in the lower-right 2×2; vertical strokes from the cross become 2-cell verticals in rows 2–3; isolated left-column point is absorbed into a full bottom row (row 3).
- Overlaps are resolved by forming continuous connections (a filled bottom row and a compact 2×2/2×2+connections cluster in cols 2–3, rows 2–3), yielding the primitives listed above.
